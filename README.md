Phone number assignment API POC
This is a no-frills API written in Perl to serve up a bunch of phone numbers from a given range to users. This is purely for demo purposes. There is no authentication and there are no explicit HTTP status codes returned. Furthermore the reponses are simple text not JSON or XML as would be expected from a proper API. Do not attempt to use in a production environment. Your mileage may vary ;)
